# Simple-Retype-Validator
This is a short script I wrote to validate two input fields contained the same email address. This was written as a supplement for the WordPress plugin Contact Form 7, because it didn't seem to me like they had any way to do this. 
## Future Plans:
I would like to add email validation to the fields as well.
